# Instacart_Basket_Analysis

# Project Overview

A demo project using Jupyter Notebooks to clean, merge, analyze and finally visualize publicly available data from Instacart and fictitious customer data from CareerFoundry.

## Context

Instacart is an online grocery store accessed through a mobile app. Although they have a strong sales track record, they are eager to delve deeper into their sales patterns and uncover more insights.

## Objectives

Conducting an initial data and exploratory analysis of select Instacart data to extract insights and propose segmentation strategies based on the specified criteria.

Tasks include:

- Cleaning and merging four datasets: order data, product data, department data, and customer data.
- Analyzing the data to address inquiries from the marketing and sales teams, such as identifying peak times of the day, the most lucrative days of the week, popular product categories, and the most loyal customers.
- Investigating variations in users' ordering patterns based on diverse characteristics like region, gender, income, loyalty status, etc.
- Formulating customer profiles by combining variables and examining potential differences in ordering behaviours, such as those observed in married couples, singles, young adults, etc.
